# In-house Demo for Unity Cinemachine

## What this project demonstrates
This project demos the implementation of a basic follow and look at target camera using Unity Cinemachine. It uses the vehicle asset from Unity Standard Assets and setups a camera to follow the vehicle using cinemachine.

## Implementation Details

### Import the Cinemachine package from asset store
- Download the Cinemachine as plugin from the asset store. Linked [here](http://u3d.as/GJQ).
- Import the Cinemachine into your project.

### Import vehicle package from Standard Assets (Optional)
- If you want to try the feature on some standard assets, then import the vehicle package.
- But preferably, you should have your own project in which you want to use the Cinemachine. In that case, skip this step.
